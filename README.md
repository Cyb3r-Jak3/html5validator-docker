This is a docker container that I made to test the html code for [my website](https://www.jwhite.network). It setups up a container which has [https://github.com/svenkreiss/html5validator](html5validator) installed. Which saves time with the testing process.

## To use

You use this the same way you use any docker image. I use it for my gitlab pipelines and you can view example configuration of testing [here](https://github.com/jwhite1st/portfolio-website/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml).
